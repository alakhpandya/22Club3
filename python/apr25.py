1.	Angles Of Valid Triangle?
    Problem Description
    You are given 3 integer angles(in degrees) A, B and C of a triangle. You have to tell whether the triangle is valid or not.
    A triangle is valid if sum of its angles equals to 180.
    Problem Constraints
    1 <= A, B, C <= 180

    Input Format
    First line of the input contains an integer A.
    Second line of the input contains an integer B.
    Third line of the input contains an integer C.

    Output Format
    Print 1 if the triangle having given sides is valid, else print 0.

    Example Input
    Input 1:
    60
    60
    60
    Input 2:
    30
    40
    50
    Example Output
    Output 1:
    1 
    Output 2:
    0

2.	Profit Or Loss
    Problem Description
    You are given the Cost Price C and Selling Price S of a Product. You have to tell whether there is a Profit or Loss. Also, calculate total profit or loss. It is guaranteed that Cost Price and Selling Price are not equal.
    Problem Constraints
    1 <= C, S <= 109, C ≠ S
    Input Format
    First line of the input contains a single integer C.
    Second line of the input contains a single integer S.
    Output Format
    Print two integers in separate lines.
    First integer denotes whether there is a profit or loss. If there is a profit, print 1, else print -1.
    Second integer is a non-negative integer denoting the absolute value of total profit or loss.
    Example Input
    Input 1:
    2
    4
    Input 2:
    4
    1
    Example Output
    Output 1:
    1
    2
    Output 2:
    -1
    3
3.	Max of two
    Problem Description

    Problem Constraints
    1 <= A <= 1000000
    1 <= B <= 1000000
    Input Format
    First line is a single integer A.
    Second line is a single integer B.
    Output Format
    One line containing the greater integer A or B.
    Example Input
    Input 1:
    5 
    6
    Input 2:
    1000 
    10000
    Example Output
    Output 1:
    6
    Output 2:
    10000

    a. if a>=2:
        print("TRUE")
    b. if (a=>2):
        print("TRUE")
    c. if (a%2!=0):
        print("TRUE")
    d. if a//3=1:
        print("TRUE")

5.	Roller Coaster Ride
    Problem Description
    Write a program that takes the age of the user as input and tells them if they're old enough to ride a roller coaster. The minimum age to ride the roller coaster in this question is 13.
    Input Format
    There is only 1 single line in the input, which is the age of the user.
    Output Format
    Print the following if user can ride the roller coaster:
    You can ride the roller coaster!
    Print the following if user can't ride the roller coaster:
    You can't ride the roller coaster.
    Example Input
    Input 1:-
    9
    Input 2:-
    13
    Example Output
    Output 1:-
    You can't ride the roller coaster.
    Output 2:-
    You can ride the roller coaster!
