"""
1. Write a Python program to get a string from a given string where all occurrences of its first character have been changed to '$', except the first character itself.

Sample String : 'restart your computer'
Expected Result : 'resta$t you$ compute$'

2. Write a Python program to find the first appearance of the substring 'not' and 'poor' from a given string, if 'not' follows the 'poor', replace the whole 'not'...'poor' substring with 'good'. Print the resulting string.

Sample String : 'The lyrics is not that poor!'
'The lyrics is poor!'
Expected Result : 'The lyrics is good!'
'The lyrics is poor!'

3. Write a Python function that takes a list of words and return the longest word and the length of the longest one

Sample:
input list = ["you", "should", "do", "exercise", "daily"]
Longest word: Exercise
Length of the longest word: 8

4. Write a Python program to remove the nth index character from a nonempty string.


5. Write a Python program to remove the characters which have odd index values of a given string.

6. Write a Python program to count the occurrences of each word in a given sentence.

7. Write a Python program that accepts a comma separated sequence of words (all in lower case, without any special character) as input and prints the unique words in sorted form (alphanumerically).

Sample Words : red, white, black, red, green, black
Expected Result : black, green, red, white,red

8. Write a Python function to create the HTML string with tags around the word(s).

Sample function and result :
add_tags('h1', 'Python') -> '<h1>Python</h1>'
add_tags('p', 'Python Tutorial') -> '<p>Python Tutorial </p>'

9. Write a Python function to insert a string in the middle of a string.

Sample function and result :
insert_sting_middle('[[]]', 'Python') -> [[Python]]
insert_sting_middle('{{}}', 'PHP') -> {{PHP}}

10. Write a Python program to create a Caesar's cipher encryption.

In cryptography, a Caesar cipher, also known as Caesar's cipher, the shift cipher, Caesar's code or Caesar shift, is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet. For example, with a left shift of 3, D would be replaced by A, E would become B, and so on. The method is named after Julius Caesar, who used it in his private correspondence.

sample:
input string: Meet me in the park
shift: 3
output string: phhw ph lq wkh sdun

sample-2:
input string: Meet me in the park
shift: -7
output string: fxxm fx bg max itkd
