    1. Categorize the person
    Problem Description
    Write a program to input from the user a float value(A) representing the height of person. You have to print the category of that person.

    If the height is greater than or equal to 195 then that person is "abnormal".
    If the height is in the range of [165 -195) then that person is "taller".
    If the height is in the range of [150 -165) then that person is "average".
    If the height is smaller than 150 then that person is a "dwarf".


    2. Write a C program to accept a coordinate point in a XY coordinate system and determine in which quadrant the coordinate point lies.
    Enter x coordinate: 7
    Enter y coordinate: 9
    Expected Output :
    The coordinate point (7,9) lies in the First quadrant.
    
    3. Write a C program to find the eligibility of admission for a professional course based on the following criteria:
    Eligibility Criteria : 
    Marks in Maths >=65 and 
    Marks in Phy >=55 and 
    Marks in Chem>=50 and 
    Total in all three subject >=190 or Total in Maths and Physics >=140 ------------------------------------- 
    Enter the marks obtained in Physics :65 Input the marks obtained in Chemistry :51 Input the marks obtained in Mathematics :72 Total marks of Maths, Physics and Chemistry : 188 Total marks of Maths and Physics : 137 The candidate is not eligible.
    Expected Output :
    The candidate is not eligible for admission.

    4. Write a program to print whether the roots of a quadratic equation are two real roots, unique or imaginary.
    if the quadratic equation is: (a*x^2) + b*x + c = 0 then the two roots are real if square root of (b^2 - 4*a*c) > 0. If (b^2 - 4*a*c) = 0 then there is unique root and if (b^2 - 4*a*c) < 0 then the roots are imaginary. Ask values of a, b & c from user and print the appropriate answer.
